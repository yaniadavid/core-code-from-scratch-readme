## Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages
For the various programming languages, there are two ways to run them. These are: Compiled and Interpreted (and some languages use both).
Compiled languages are those where the complete code is taken and converted into machine language as a whole, this translation remains permanent and if changes were made to the original code it must be compiled again.
Interpreted languages, on the other hand, will be translated line by line at the time of execution. Therefore, it will use the original code and it will be modified in each execution
